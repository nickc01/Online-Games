This repository contains a list of some of the games I made that are available online. Here are the games:

## [Badland Battles](https://nickc01.github.io/Online-Games/Badland%20Battles/)

[Repository](https://github.com/nickc01/Badland-Battles)

Badland Battles is a demo game that is designed to test out several advanced Unity features. This was developed for the GPE340 college class. This demo is designed to test

* Playing Mixamo animations
* Using root motion
* Using baked lighting, lighting probes, and reflection probes
* Using particle effects
* Using spatial and non-spatical audio sources
* Stopping time when pausing the game
* Using a Nav-Mesh to have the enemies navigate the world

## [Nitro](https://nickc01.github.io/Online-Games/Nitro/)

[Repository](https://github.com/nickc01/Nitro)

Nitro is a powerup system that makes it easy to implement different kinds of powerups for your game. The game link is a demonstration of this system.

It not only includes the ability to build regular powerups and combinable powerups, but it also provides several tools and components to make it easier to integrate powerups into your game system, such as:

- **Nitro Variables** | A special kind of variable that can easily be modified and reverted, making it easier to have stats that are changed temporarily when a powerup is collected or running over a hazard
- **Collidable** : A component that makes it easy for keeping track of object that collide with it
- **Collectors** : Components that make it easy for collecting, storing and executing powerups.

## [Hacktrons](https://nickc01.github.io/Online-Games/Hacktrons/)

[Repository](https://github.com/nickc01/Hacktrons)

Hacktrons is a turn-based strategy game made for college class. It is based on an old Lego game called Spybotics: The Nightball Incident, and I decided to build a recreation of it within the span of two weeks. The first week was mostly focused on making a trailer for the game (since the class required that too), and the second week was focused on finishing a workable verison of the game. In the game, you play as a CIA agent, defeating viruses in network nodes by uploading programs to destroy them. When it's your turn, you can move each of your programs around a map, and if they are near an enemy, you can attack them. Once all of your programs have done their moves, then it will switch to the enemy's turn, and they have the ability to attack you. This goes back and forth until you or the enemy looses all of their programs.

## [UATanks](https://nickc01.github.io/Online-Games/UATanks/)

[Repository](https://github.com/nickc01/UATanks)

UATanks is a top-down tank shooting game, where your goal is to control a tank in an arena and destroy all the other tanks to win. It is one of the larger projects I have made during college, and is used to demonstrate features such as:
- Having each tank have a different "personality", by giving each type of a tank a different AI
- An options menu for changing key settings for the game
- Having a multitude of different powerups and effects
- A mini-map for knowing where everything is located
- A map that is procedurally generated
- Splitscreen multiplayer
- A highscore system
- Saving option settings to disk via PlayerPrefs
